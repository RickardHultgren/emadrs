**Staff attitudes towards follow-up of depression treatment via the patient's mobile phone.**

*Background and purpose of the study*
Guidelines for the treatment and follow-up of depression exist, but the increase in mental problems among young people poses a major challenge. The purpose of this work is to investigate what potential, seen from a staff perspective, a digital form of the depression estimation scale MADRS-S may have as a clinical follow-up instrument. Since 2001, MADRS-S has been a validated self-assessment tool for depression symptoms. The form consists of 9 questions where the patient answers with a rating from 0 to 6. The total score is the survey result. A digital prototype for mobile phones (eMADRS) was developed by the first author of the research project in question. The app consists of a form where the result is sent to the specified number as an SMS text message. The app will be presented to the staff and their attitude will be investigated. The aim is also to collect proposals for further development of eMADRS. The research question is: What advantages and disadvantages are identified from a professional clinical perspective using a digital follow-up instrument for depression?

*Materials and Methods*
Interviews with at least two focus groups, consisting of about 5-7 people from different categories of staff involved in the treatment of unipolar disorder. Personnel categories concerned are primarily doctors, nurses and paraprofessional. Other occupational groups, such as curators and psychologists may come into question. The interviews are then analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The project is planned to be done in Region Jämtland-Härjedalen.

*Specific goal/Expected significance*
...

*Medical or clinical relevance of the project.*
If significant benefits and potentials were to be identified, then eMADRs could be a complement in the follow-up of depression patients.

*Planned format and language of the essay*
The project is planned to be written as a scientific article in LaTeX with the Elsevier style guide.
